 ## Project Description

 This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze call center data. The key goals were to:

- Provide insights into call volume, sentiment, and complaint types
- Identify trends in response time and service level adherence
- Compare performance across different channels and locations
- Enable data-driven decision making for call center operations

The dashboard combines data from call logs, transcripts, surveys, and other sources. It utilizes various charts, metrics, and filters to slice the data by relevant dimensions.

Key visualizations include:

- Call volume and sentiment breakdowns
- Analysis of call drivers by most common complaint reasons
- Response time analysis against service level agreements
- Call center volume and performance by location
- Channel analysis comparing call center, email, chat, and web
